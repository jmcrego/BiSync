# BiSync

BiSync is a writing assistant that allows to edit and synchronize text in two languages.
             
In the most general setting, BiSync works as a classical MT system providing the translation of input sentences. In addition, when the user refines (post-edits) a preceding translation in either language, BiSync transforms the text in the other language to restore translation parallelism. BiSync is trained to restore parallelism by following similar updates to those introduced by the user. Follow paper and code for further details on the BiSync network.
